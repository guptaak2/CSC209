This solution illustrates a more elegant way to pick up 'permute' and
'ispalindrome' from the correct directory.  Remember that PATH is where the
shell finds commands when you type a command which does not contain a slash.

You didn't have to do this for this assignment, but in real life, every shell
script should start with an assignment to the PATH variable (usually saying
simply /bin:/usr/bin).  Explanation at
