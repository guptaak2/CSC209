The external 'cd' command changes the current directory of that new process.
If _that_ process were to fork any child processes of its own, the subsequent
processes would inherit its new current working directory.  However, this
does not affect fsh, which is the parent of that process.

Thus cd needs to be a built-in for pretty much the same reason that exit
does: we want to change the current working directory of THIS process, and
all future children of this process, but changing the current working
directory of some other existing process does not accomplish that.
